# Developing Guild Chest

## Develop in VS Code

Host prerequisites: **VS Code**, its **Dev Containers** extension, and a running
Docker Engine / Docker Desktop configured for Linux containers. The SteamCMD
workflow uses x86-64 Linux; this repository's container was built on an x86-64
Linux host. No host .NET SDK or Unity Editor is required.

1. Open this repository in VS Code.
2. Run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** from the Command Palette.
3. Wait for the container's automatic setup to finish. It downloads roughly
   2.2 GB of Valheim Dedicated Server files using anonymous SteamCMD login,
   fetches pinned BepInEx and Jötunn dependencies, and then restores NuGet
   packages. No Steam account credentials are needed. Every container start
   checks for Valheim server updates and validates the installed files.

4. Run **Build Debug** (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) and **Run Tests**, or:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project build -- --target Compile
   dotnet run --project build -- --target Test
   ```

5. Run **Package Release**, or:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project build -- --target Package
   ```

The release ZIP is written to `artifacts/GuildChest-1.1.0.zip`, visible in the
host workspace. Container rebuilds retain downloaded references in `.local`
and NuGet packages in the `guild-chest-nuget` Docker volume. Post-create prepares
the GitHub CLI configuration permissions. Post-start runs
`dotnet run --project build -- --target Restore --update-references` on every
start. This updates and validates the Valheim server files through SteamCMD and
refetches pinned mod dependencies before restoring NuGet packages. Wait for this
command to finish before building. Run
**Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** once to apply this startup hook to an
existing container.

If an update fails with an existing cached Steam installation, setup backs up
`steamapps/appmanifest_896660.acf` as `appmanifest_896660.acf.before-recovery`
inside `.local/valheim-server`, then retries once with fresh installation
metadata. This handles Steam denying access to an older depot manifest after a
game update. Cached server files stay available for validation against the current
public build. If recovery fails, setup restores the previous metadata and stops
the build; it does not record the attempted update as successful.

The dev container includes Codex CLI, installed as `vscode` using
[OpenAI's official shell installer](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli).
Run **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** to add it to an existing container,
then run `codex` in the container terminal. Your host `~/.codex` directory is
mounted read-write at `/home/vscode/.codex`, sharing authentication, configuration,
and session history. Sign in when prompted if you have not already done so.
The CLI and daemon packages are installed with the official installer and kept
in the `guild-chest-codex-packages` Docker volume. Daemon runtime files use the
`guild-chest-codex-daemon` and `guild-chest-codex-control` volumes. These mount over
the corresponding directories inside `.codex`, keeping executable symlinks,
process IDs, and sockets local to
the container while sharing the rest of your Codex state with the host.

Codex's Linux sandbox uses Bubblewrap to create nested namespaces. The container
installs `bubblewrap` explicitly and starts with `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`
to allow the namespace calls that Docker's default seccomp filter blocks. This
disables Docker's syscall filtering for this dev container; Codex still enforces
its own filesystem and network sandbox. After **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container**,
verify the sandbox from the container terminal with:

```bash
codex sandbox -- true
```

The command should exit successfully. A `bwrap: No permissions to create new
namespace` error means the container or host still blocks namespace creation.
See [OpenAI's sandbox guidance](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security#os-level-sandbox)
for container requirements.

The dev container mounts the Linux host's `~/.ssh` directory read-only at
`/home/vscode/.ssh`, so Git can use your existing GitHub SSH key. After changing
the container configuration, run **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** to apply
the mount. Verify authentication inside the container with `ssh -T git@github.com`
before pushing. GitHub's successful authentication greeting exits with status 1.
If your key has a passphrase, SSH prompts for it unless an agent has it loaded;
VS Code also forwards a running host SSH agent automatically. Because the mount
is read-only, add any missing GitHub host-key entry to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` on
the host by running `ssh -T git@github.com` there first.

The dev container also includes GitHub CLI (`gh`) from
[GitHub's official apt repository](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian).
Run **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** to add it to an existing container.
Authenticate once inside the rebuilt container with `gh auth login` and verify
with `gh auth status` before using commands such as `gh pr list` or `gh pr checks`.
The `guild-chest-gh` Docker volume persists `/home/vscode/.config/gh` across
container rebuilds, so subsequent rebuilds retain your login. The post-create
command restores ownership for the container user if its UID changes. Deleting
this volume removes the saved login. In this container, GitHub CLI falls back to
[storing its token in a plain-text configuration file](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login)
when no system credential store is available; the directory is restricted to the
container user and stays outside the repository.

The repository's `.codex/config.toml` selects the `github-workspace` permission
profile. It keeps workspace file protections and enables Codex's network proxy
for GitHub API requests, raw files, source archives, and release downloads;
`api.nuget.org` for .NET package restores; and `thunderstore.io` and
`ccdn.thunderstore.io` for pinned mod dependency downloads. Other command-network
destinations still require approval. This lets `gh` verify credentials instead
of reporting a misleading invalid-token error when the sandbox blocks GitHub.
Codex loads these settings for trusted projects. Start a new Codex session to
apply changes; no container rebuild is needed. Explicit permission-profile or
sandbox selections can override the project default. Verify the default from the
container terminal with `codex sandbox -- gh auth status --active`. See the
[Codex network configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security#network-access)
for details.

The C# extension is configured to handle the SDK-style `net48` plugin. If
VS Code opens before automatic setup finishes, wait for it to complete and then
run **Developer: Reload Window** to refresh unresolved game symbols. If reference
setup fails, retry with **Tasks: Run Task → Setup References** or
`dotnet run --project build -- --target Setup`.

To debug automated tests, start **Debug Test Host**, wait for its process ID,
then select **Attach to .NET test host** in the Run and Debug panel and pick that
`testhost` process. Gameplay runs in your separately installed Valheim client
or server; inspect its `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for mod diagnostics.

## References and builds

The plugin targets **.NET Framework 4.8**, its game-independent core targets
**.NET Standard 2.0**, and tests run on **.NET 10**. Linux builds obtain the
Framework reference assemblies from NuGet. The dev container image is pinned
by digest, and NuGet lock files are checked in.

Build orchestration uses [NUKE](https://nuke.build/) in the standalone
`build/_build.csproj` project. The SDK restores the pinned runner dependencies
in locked mode; no global NUKE tool or shell wrapper is required. List targets
and parameters with:

```bash
dotnet run --project build -- --help
```

| Target | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Setup` | Fetch missing references and pinned mod dependencies; add `--update-references` to refresh. |
| `Restore` | Set up references and restore the product solution in locked mode. |
| `Compile` | Set up, restore, and build Debug; use `--configuration Release` for Release. |
| `Test` | Restore the test project and run C# and Python tests without game downloads. |
| `Package` | Build Release and create the ZIP after validating the build receipt. |
| `NativeSmoke` | Restore and compile the optional native fixture in Release. |
| `Compatibility` | Run tests, fetch fresh references, build Debug, package Release, and compile the native fixture. |
| `ValidateRelease` | Check `--release-tag` against the manifest, verify main-branch ancestry, and validate categorized release notes. |
| `Checksum` | Build the package and write its `.zip.sha256` file. |
| `Release` | Validate the tag, test, fetch fresh references, build Debug, package Release, and write the checksum. |

Multiple targets share dependencies within one invocation, for example
`dotnet run --project build -- --target Compile Package`. Parameters after the
`--` belong to NUKE; `dotnet run --configuration Release` before it selects the
runner's configuration, while `--configuration Release` after it selects the
product build and test configuration. Packaging always builds Release.
`Release` and `Compatibility` use Debug for their solution build by default;
neither target runs gameplay checks or publishes a release.

`ValheimManagedDir` defaults to the downloaded server's
`.local/valheim-server/valheim_server_Data/Managed` directory. Override it when
building against a different client or server installation:

```bash
dotnet run --project build -- --target Compile --valheim-managed-dir /path/to/Managed
```

This uses the supplied assemblies without running SteamCMD; setup fetches only
missing pinned mod dependencies. Relative paths resolve from the repository
root. With an override, `--update-references` refreshes the mod dependencies and
leaves the supplied game installation alone. `Release` and `Compatibility`
require the default reference source so they can validate fresh downloads.

Game downloads and dependency DLLs are ignored by Git and excluded from the
release ZIP. `.local/references.json` records the Managed directory, dependency
versions, and assembly SHA-256 hashes. Default downloads also record the Steam
manifest/build ID; custom references use absolute hash keys for external files
and do not claim the downloaded server's Steam manifest. To update the game
references deliberately and refetch pinned mod dependencies:

```bash
dotnet run --project build -- --target Setup --update-references
```

Compile and package targets fetch missing references automatically and reuse
existing downloads. Core tests do not run reference setup. The original game
assemblies are referenced directly; Harmony accesses the few private fields and
methods needed by the mod.
No publicizer or proprietary assemblies are committed.

See [code structure](ARCHITECTURE.md) for module responsibilities and adapter
boundaries. Change `version_number` in `manifest.json` to set the release version;
the build generates the plugin constant and assembly versions. Packaging checks
the build receipt against both DLLs and rejects stale or replaced binaries.

## GitHub automation and releases

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run two independent CI checks using the same
NUKE targets as local development:

- **tests** invokes `Test`, which restores the core test project in locked mode
  and runs the C# and Python suites without downloading Valheim. Python tests
  also exercise the real NUKE target graph against disposable repositories and
  recording tools, checking dependency sharing, release gates, and failure handling.
- **build-package** invokes `Compile Package`, which sets up game references,
  restores the solution in locked mode, builds Debug, and produces the
  installable Release ZIP.

Open a run under **Actions → CI** to download `guild-chest-package`, test
results, and build diagnostics. Artifacts are retained for 14 days. The package
artifact wraps the installable `GuildChest-<version>.zip`; extract that outer
artifact before installing. These CI packages are development builds, not
published releases. Require the `tests` and `build-package` checks in the `main`
branch ruleset to block merging failing changes.

CI caches NuGet packages by lock-file hashes and game references by setup
script, manifest, and UTC week. A cache miss downloads roughly 2.2 GB; later
runs reuse the reference assemblies. Builds run in the same pinned .NET base
image as the dev container, with build prerequisites but without its Codex
installation or host credential mounts.

**Valheim compatibility** runs every Monday at 06:17 UTC and can be started
manually from Actions through the `Compatibility` target. It always checks
`main` against fresh game references, runs the automated suites, builds/packages
the plugin, and compiles the optional native fixture. Its diagnostics include
setup/build logs, test results, and
`references.json` with the Steam build and assembly hashes. Compilation does
not establish native runtime or gameplay compatibility; use the validation
checklist for those checks. Configure GitHub Actions notifications to receive
failure notifications. Dependabot also opens weekly grouped update PRs for
NuGet packages and pinned GitHub Actions; updates require review and passing CI.

To release a new version:

1. Update `version_number` in `manifest.json`, update the relevant documentation,
   and write `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` using the
   [release-note authoring guidelines](#writing-release-notes). Review changes
   since the previous release and include a comparison link after the sections.
   Commit the notes and merge the change into `main` after CI and relevant
   gameplay checks pass.
2. Tag the merged commit with the exact manifest version and push that tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Guild Chest X.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. The **Release** workflow invokes the NUKE `Release` target, which verifies
   that the tag is exactly `v<manifest version>` and its commit belongs to
   `main`, and checks that the release notes start with Mod changes, have unique,
   nonempty category headings, and include a bullet in each section. It reruns
   tests, downloads fresh references without using reference or NuGet caches,
   builds Debug, and packages Release.
4. After validation succeeds, it creates a **draft GitHub release** containing
   the checked-in release notes, the installable ZIP, and a `.zip.sha256` checksum.
   Review the notes, package, reference build, and relevant gameplay results,
   then publish the draft from GitHub's Releases page.

Stable `vX.Y.Z` tags are supported; prerelease tags are rejected. Validation
failures create no release. Rerunning a successful workflow can replace assets on
an existing draft, but refuses to modify a published release. The draft workflow
uses GitHub's built-in token; only its final job receives `contents: write`.
Publishing the reviewed GitHub release triggers the separate Thunderstore and
Nexus Mods workflows when their respective `THUNDERSTORE_PUBLISH_ENABLED` and
`NEXUSMODS_PUBLISH_ENABLED` repository variables are `true`. Both consume the
exact reviewed GitHub archive without rebuilding. Nexus 1.1.0 was published
manually; automation only accepts later stable versions. See
[Thunderstore publishing and retries](THUNDERSTORE.md)
and [Nexus Mods configuration, preflight, and recovery](NEXUSMODS.md).
GitHub workflows do not bump versions, create tags, or publish drafts automatically.

To exercise release validation and packaging locally without creating or
publishing a GitHub release:

```bash
dotnet run --project build -- --target Release --release-tag v1.1.0
```

### Writing release notes

Review the changes between the previous release tag and the proposed release
commit. Write the notes in `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` and keep **Mod changes** as
the first `##` section. Include player-facing behavior, visuals, fixes, and
compatibility there; use `- None.` when there are no player-facing changes.

Group the remaining changes into a small number of broad, descriptive `##`
categories based on their actual subjects. Related changes should share a
heading, with the individual details in separate bullets. Prefer headings that
can cover several related changes, such as **Development tooling** or
**Publishing**, over a heading for every individual change. A narrower category
containing a single change is appropriate when its subject is substantially
different from the other changes and deserves a separate heading.

Only **Mod changes** is predefined. Additional categories and their order come
from the changes being described; omit unused categories. Each included section
needs at least one `- ` bullet. Category names must be nonempty and unique,
ignoring case and surrounding whitespace. Write headings as `## Category name`
without closing `#` markers. Use meaningful subject categories in
new notes instead of the **Other changes** catchall. Existing published notes
retain their content and remain valid.

A release limited to a player-facing fix can contain only:

```markdown
## Mod changes

- Fix shared chest contents failing to refresh after a transfer.
```

A release with download and publishing changes could instead use:

```markdown
## Mod changes

- None.

## Development tooling

- Recover incomplete reference installations before compiling.
- Refresh game references when the development container starts.

## Publishing

- Verify the published archive before uploading it to distribution sites.
- Preserve dependency requirements when recovering an interrupted upload.
```

These category names are examples; choose headings that describe each release.
Keep any release title above the sections and the comparison link after them.
The checked-in notes provide the GitHub release body and the packaged
`CHANGELOG.md` used by Thunderstore. Nexus converts those notes to plain entries
while preserving the chosen category names and order, joining wrapped bullets,
and pinning links to the release tag.

## Project structure

- `src/GuildChest`: prefab, vanilla UI adapter, RPC protocol, native serialization,
  persistent world state, ward checks, and Harmony patches.
- `src/GuildChest.Core`: world inventory revisions, leases, chest membership,
  retry receipts, and final-chest removal rules.
- `tests/GuildChest.Tests`: game-independent synchronization tests.
- `tests/GuildChest.NativeSmoke`: optional native fixtures for a disposable server;
  see the validation notes. This test plugin is excluded from the release ZIP.
- `build`: standalone NUKE build runner and shared game-reference properties.
- `scripts`: Python reference setup, release validation, and deterministic packaging.

Feature releases increment the second version number and reset the third; bugfix
releases increment the third. Mixed releases follow the feature-release rule.
Published 1.0.12 remains part of the release history.
