# Nexus Mods 1.1.0 launch fields

These fields record the original manual 1.1.0 launch. For later releases, use
the [manual page-update checklist](../NEXUSMODS.md#manual-page-updates-after-a-release)
and maintained [main-page BBCode](page-description.bbcode). Do not copy this
file's 1.1.0 version, main-file description, or initial changelog into a later
release. Copy only each field's fenced contents, without the backticks, when
referring to the original launch fields.

## Mod name

Use the Nexus account's actual author/display name. If a separate author field
allows a project credit, `Guild Chest contributors` matches the repository's
copyright notice. No new team account is required for the launch.

## Initial changelog

Select version `1.1.0`. Paste these entries into separate changelog lines if the
editor uses an entry list. This is a Nexus introduction, based on the already
published GitHub version; it does not replace that release's checked-in notes.

```text
Initial Nexus Mods release of Guild Chest, using the existing GitHub 1.1.0 archive.
All Guild Chests in a world share one 32-slot inventory, with normal ward permissions and one player accessing it at a time.
Shared contents remain in the world save when the last chest is destroyed and can be accessed by rebuilding a Guild Chest, including after a restart.
Version 1.1.0 removes legacy spill-recovery handling for older saves; current final-chest retention remains unchanged.
The GitHub release ZIP was installed through Vortex and tested successfully by the author.
```

## Credits

```text
Guild Chest contributors.
BepInEx team for the plugin framework.
Jötunn / ValheimModding contributors for the Valheim modding library.
Iron Gate Studio for Valheim.
