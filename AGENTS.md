# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/GuildChest/`: .NET Framework 4.8 Valheim plugin, including RPCs, serialization, Harmony patches, and storage-mod adapters.
- `src/GuildChest.Core/`: game-independent .NET Standard 2.0 leases, revisions, and transfer lifecycle logic.
- `tests/GuildChest.Tests/`: .NET 10 xUnit tests; `tests/test_package.py`: Python packaging tests.
- `tests/GuildChest.NativeSmoke/`: optional BepInEx integration fixture, excluded from releases.
- `build/`: standalone .NET 10 NUKE runner and shared assembly references; `scripts/`: Python setup, packaging, and release validation helpers. `docs/` covers architecture, compatibility, and gameplay validation. Root `icon.png` supplies the package icon.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use the VS Code dev container with Docker; `global.json` selects the .NET 10 SDK.

- `dotnet run --project build -- --help`: list NUKE targets and parameters; no global NUKE tool is required.
- `dotnet run --project build -- --target Setup`: download game references and pinned dependencies; initial downloads are roughly 2.2 GB. Add `--update-references` to refresh.
- `dotnet run --project build -- --target Compile`: prepare references, restore locked dependencies, and compile the solution in Debug configuration.
- `dotnet run --project build -- --target Test`: run xUnit and Python `unittest` checks without downloading game references.
- `dotnet run --project build -- --target Package`: build Release binaries and generate `artifacts/GuildChest-<version>.zip` after validating build receipts.
- `dotnet run --project build -- --target Compatibility`: test against fresh references and compile the optional native fixture.
- `dotnet run --project build -- --target Release --release-tag vX.Y.Z`: validate the tag/main ancestry, test, build with fresh references, and package with a checksum. Does not publish a release.

Gameplay runs in a separately installed Valheim client or server. Override game references with `dotnet run --project build -- --target Compile --valheim-managed-dir /path/to/Managed`. Keep the NUKE package version and build project lock file pinned.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow `.editorconfig`: UTF-8, LF, final newline, and four-space indentation; JSON/YAML use two spaces. C# uses language version 10, nullable references, file-scoped namespaces, PascalCase types/methods, and camelCase locals/private fields. Match surrounding brace and layout conventions. Python uses snake_case. No dedicated formatter or linter is configured.

## Testing Guidelines

Name C# files `*Tests.cs` and use descriptive behavior names with `[Fact]` or `[Theory]`; Python files use `test_*.py` and methods use `test_*`. Add regression coverage for synchronization, transfer, and packaging changes. No numeric coverage threshold is configured. Run `dotnet run --project build -- --target Test` before submitting. Native/gameplay changes need relevant disposable-world checks from `docs/VALIDATION.md`; native fixtures are outside the normal test command.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History uses imperative, descriptive subjects such as “Refactor storage compatibility and release packaging,” without a fixed prefix scheme. Keep commits focused. PRs should explain behavior changes, link applicable issues, report automated and gameplay validation, and include screenshots for visible changes.

Write release notes in `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` before tagging. Always use `## Mod changes` first for player-facing mod behavior, visuals, fixes, and compatibility; use `- None.` there when there are no player-facing changes. Review changes since the previous release and group remaining changes under a small number of broad, descriptive `##` headings derived from that release's actual changes. Related changes should share a category; avoid giving each change its own heading. A narrower category containing a single change is appropriate when its subject is substantially different from the other changes. Only Mod changes is predefined; choose additional category names and their order for each release, and omit unused categories. Give every included section at least one bullet and keep category names nonempty and unique, ignoring case and surrounding whitespace. Use meaningful subject categories instead of the Other changes catchall in new notes. Historical notes remain valid and should retain their published content. See the [release-note authoring examples](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#writing-release-notes). The release workflow validates the structure and uses the checked-in file as the GitHub release body.

## Architecture & Configuration

Keep inventory authority on the host; apply client transfers and effects after acknowledgement. Preserve staged-inventory scope restoration. Set release versions in `manifest.json`. Keep downloaded DLLs, `.local/`, generated binaries, and credentials out of Git; retain NuGet lock files.
